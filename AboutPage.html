    <h1>Mission</h1>
    <p>GP Transmission is a family owned business that treats you like family. 
        Giving you that uncle Jerry special at a friendly fair price. 
        People come in asking for custom fixes and modifications to their cars and with a can do attitude, 
        the employees of GP Transmission aim to give the best customer service experience possible.</p>
   
    <p> We take our responsibility to our clients seriously. 
        We are focused. At the same time, we have a great time getting the job done. 
        Sometimes our office is so quiet you can hear a pin drop; while at other times, 
        every marketing services team member has a client on the phone and there are beach balls flying across the garage.
    We take great pride in our team-building skills. 
    We carefully select and screen each new team member for their individual talents and their fit with our company culture. 
    Although not a requirement, skills with a Nerf gun are considered a valuable asset.
    </p>
